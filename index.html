                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am currently employed by the federal government, specializing in business intelligence and project
                    management.
                    While my work experience has been nothing short of amazing, I'd like to transition to a faster-paced
                    work environment in a customer-engaging role. The most rewarding project I have lead so far focused
                    on
                    working closely with
                    users to design and develop a business intelligence tool for process improvement analytics. The
                    process of
                    iteratively solving user problems and contributing to creating
                    something out of nothing is what I am looking for.</p>
                <p>I strive to be a lifelong learner and seriously value the self-learning I do in my free time through
                    projects, online courses, and reading at an average pace of one book per week. Navigate to my
                    projects page to
                    view some of the work I have done in the past or things I am currently working on. You can also find
                    a list of some of my
                    favourite
                    nonfiction books that span a myriad of disciplines in my bookshelf.</p>

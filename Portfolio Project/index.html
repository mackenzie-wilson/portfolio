                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am currently employed at Canada Revenue Agency as a Program Officer specializing in business
                    intelligence and project management for a continuous improvement team. While I am grateful for my
                    experience, I am looking to transition to something I am passionate about â€“ technology. The most
                    rewarding times throughout my professional career have been working on building projects that bring
                    something new to a team. The process of iteratively solving problems and contributing to creating
                    something out of nothing is what I am looking for.</p>
                <p>I strive to be a lifelong learner and seriously value the self-learning I do in my free time through
                    projects, online courses, and reading at an average pace of one book per week. Navigate to my
                    projects page to
                    view some of the work I have done in the past on my own. You can also find a list of some of my
                    favourite
                    nonfiction books that span a myriad of disciplines in my bookshelf.</p>
